# Pyomo

This GitHub repository provides a collection of solved examples in the Pyomo environment, a Python package for modeling and solving optimization problems. The solved problems in this repository are mainly related to supply chain management and power systems, two important areas in the field of operations research.
The examples are provided in the form of Jupyter notebooks, which include a description of the problem, the formulation of the optimization model, the implementation of the model in Pyomo, and the solution of the problem using a solver such as Gurobi or CBC. The notebooks also include visualizations of the results and an analysis of the solution.
The repository is open for contributions, so users can add their own examples or improve existing ones. Users can also fork the repository and use the examples as a starting point for their own optimization problems.
This repository is a resource for anyone interested in learning how to use Pyomo for modeling and solving optimization problems in the areas of supply chain management and power systems. The examples provide a practical and hands-on approach to learning the Pyomo environment, and the Jupyter notebooks make it easy to follow along and replicate the examples. The repository is also a great way to collaborate with others in the optimization community and to share knowledge and expertise.
